# SFDX EasySpaces App

The project is an attempt to take the Salesforce packaging SFDX to the next level of modularization. 

[Zayne Turner](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/author/zayne) has already defined modular development approach in her Developer [blog](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/06/announcing-the-easy-spaces-app.html) at the [GitHub](https://github.com/trailheadapps/easy-spaces) Repo

We are taking it further by decomposing the project packages in their own Repos and empower individual development team to manage the development of the packages independently. The overall project structure looks like this:

**Easy Spaces App**
